This solution contains the example code to support Sean P McDonough's
"Leveraging AOP in Custom SharePoint Development" presentation. This
solution was created with the following:

1. Visual Studio 2013 with Update 3
2. PostSharp v3.1.46

To demonstrate the use of aspects and how they can be used, you must have
a version of PostSharp installed. Although the Ultimate (paid) version of
PostSharp was used in the creation of this solution, you can obtain a free
version which will allow you to run all examples and create your own aspects
at http://www.postsharp.net/purchase (PostSharp Express).
